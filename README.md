As a part of 2025 MSRI-UP at SLMath, we have analyzed the association between social vulnerability and Covid-19 cases and vaccination rates in California counties during 2021.

COVID-19 is a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which primarily attacks the respiratory system. To analyze which communities were most affected, we used the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Social Vulnerability Index (SVI). Social Vulnerability (SV) can be described as the socioeconomic and demographic factors that affect how certain communities experience societal threats. SVI is comprised of four subcategories: Socioeconomic Status, Household Characteristics, Racial and Ethnic Minority status, and Housing Type and Transportation. We collected data on these topics for all California counties. With this data, we created visualizations consisting of heatmaps, line graphs, and scatterplots. Moreover, we ran Pearson's correlation coefficient test, using R to determine which variable is most correlated to Covid-19 infection and vaccination rates. Our analysis has shown that Racial and Ethnic Minority Status correlates with the rapid spread of COVID-19 in most counties in California, while Housing Type and Transportation also have a minor correlation.
